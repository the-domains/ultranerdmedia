            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Search Buzz Video Recap: Google Web & Local Algorithm Updates, Real Time Index & AdWords Changes</h1><p>This week in search got off to a slow start but ended with a bang. We are seeing early signs of a Google core search update. Also, it seems like the core local results were updated yesterday as well.
